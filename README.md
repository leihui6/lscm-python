# lscm-python
A lightweight python project implementing least-squares conformal mapping of triangular meshes



## Third Party Dependencies

This project requires two third-party **python** library:

- [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio)
- [PyMesh](https://pymesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)



## Prerequisites

**We assume the input mesh's triangles are consistently oriented counter-clockwise .**



## Example

Here is an example of a saddle mesh:
